* Follow the 4 steps : Install App Services on your GitHub, Authorize App Services Github App, Select your repository and enable Automatic Deployment

## Getting Started
You need to modify some value in different files :
* Change line 5 (`"clusterName": "<Name-Of-Your-Cluster>"`) in `data_sources/mongodb-atlas/config.json`. Adding the name of your cluster in Mongo Atlas. The name of your cluster is next to the button `Connect` : 
![Name of Cluster](./images/cluster-name.png)
* Change line 2 (`"app_id": "<app-id>"`) in `realm_config.json`. Adding the ID of your application in App Services. You can copy the ID from your dashboard App Services :
  ![App ID](./images/app-id.png)
* Change line 4 (`"name": "<name-of-application>"`) in `realm_config.json`. Adding the name of your application in App Services. You can found the name of your application from your dashboard (in my case is `Application-0`) :
  ![App ID](./images/app-id.png)
* Change line 6 (`"provider_region": "<provider-region>"`) in `realm_config.json`. Adding your region where you have to deploy your App Service . You can found your region from the menu App Settings (in my case is `Ireland (eu-west-1) ‚Ä¢ AWS`, which give `aws-eu-west-1` ) :
  ![Deployment Region](./images/deployment-region.png)
* Commit and push your changement and after the deploy finish in App Service. You can see a new endpoint and a function `example` appear.
